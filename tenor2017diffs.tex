\begin{abstract}
We describe an application of hierarchic diff to the collaborative
editing of tree-based music representations, using Zhang and Shasha's
tree edit distance algorithm as implemented within the XUDiff tool.
The edit distance between two trees is the minimum number of edit
operations necessary to transform one tree into the other.  We
consider common operations on the score tree---deleting, changing, and
appending tree nodes---to derive a minimal edit sequence, known as an
edit script, and we compare the performance of the widely used Longest
Common Subsequence algorithm against our approach. We conclude by summarizing implications for the design of collaborative music document software systems.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
\subsection{Collaborative Document Creation Requires Diff Algorithms}
In distributed, collaborative document creation, multiple editing agents may change the same original information simultaneously, in complex and overlapping ways. To allow users to resolve conflicting edits and to create a reliable and transparent edit history, robust systems for collaborative editing often depend on \emph{Centralized Version Control Systems} (also known as \emph{Revision Control Systems (RCS)} and \emph{Source Code Management (SCM)} systems). These systems maintain a centralized information representation (\emph{repository}) and a history of users' changes to it; the difference between two edited versions of the information is known as a \emph{diff}, and this difference can be calculated and represented in various ways. Distributed, collaborative music document editing presents unique challenges for the implementation of version control systems, and especially for the implementation of a diff algorithm.

\subsection{The Longest Common Subsequence Algorithm as Default Diff}
Traditional document comparison algorithms, such as in the Unix
\texttt{diff} program, take two sequences of characters as input and
output an edit script to transform one sequence into the other.  An
\emph{edit script} consists of a sequence of edit operations (usually
insert, delete, and update) to transform the first sequence relative
to some entity---usually characters, words, or lines.  The \emph{edit
  distance} is the minimum cost the edit script gives for each
operation.  The \emph{Longest Common Subsequence algorithm} and its variants
are the most common for computing an edit script and cost.

The Longest Common Subsequence algorithm works well in situations where
the inputs are sequences of characters and one needs to compare those sequences relative to characters, words, or
lines, but many modern file formats rely on
hierarchical object models to encode multiple levels of meaning
(e.g. XML, blocks of code).  As such, different algorithms for
hierarchical structures become necessary.  

Consider the following two problems that result from this mismatch
between character- or line-based diff tools and tree-structured input.
First, comparing documents in terms of low-level entities
(e.g. lines) may not result in changes that are meaningful to the
domain, because lines are often an artifact of presentation: for
example, one can generate `noisy diffs' by just changing whitespace.
Second, the manner in which one defines document similarity may change
depending upon the task at hand.  A poet may get along fine comparing
texts in terms of lines, which reflect part of the structure of the
text.  A musician, however, may want to compare documents in terms of
additional information that a line-based approach discards.
Other communities present similar demands: scholars may want
to analyze and compare texts relative to other structures, such as
paragraphs or sections.

\subsection{Collaborative Music Information Requires a Hierarchic Diff}
As alluded to above, these problems are of specific importance to version control for collaborative music document editing, both in terms of usability as well as how one may want
to define `meaning' and `similarity' in musical information.  First,
the `noisy diff' problem---in reporting differences that are not
relevant to musicians---creates a usability problem.  Although
programmers have become accustomed to noisy diffs and the work-arounds
they require, the low adoption rate of computer-driven music analytic
tools, and the general lack of comfort among music scholars and artists with these
tools, suggest that a program producing diffs of meaningless changes
would be poorly received by the community.  Second, the meaning of
textually encoded music always requires additional interpretation, and a one-dimensional sequence of characters (the data
structure for which LCS diff was designed) will not allow
musicians to compare two different interpretations of the same musical information.  

Instead, musicians need the ability to compare musical information in
the presence of its logical organization, which must be expressed
hierarchically.  Therefore, musicians need the ability to compare two
versions of a hierarchical structure. Musicians may also want to
compare two versions of a score at different levels of abstraction, as
represented by these hierarchical structures, or restrict comparison
to entities with certain properties: for example, a musician may want
to compare two versions of a score in terms of pitch class alone, or
of higher-level features like phrase structure. Moreover, a musician
may want to filter a score to compare two versions of only a single
instrument's staff, or other musical abstractions. For any of this to be possible, diff algorithms must compare edits to tree-based document elements, rather than document lines or characters.

\subsection{Relevant Precedents in the Music and Computer Science Literatures}
From the perspective of computer science, our proposed approach leverages previous work from other domains in both
industry and in academia.  Within industry, there are proprietary,
hierarchy-aware difference engines that compare source code in a variety of 
edit operations, such as the SmartDifferencer by Semantic Designs
\cite{Designs:qm}.  Within academia, the tree diffing problem has been
long studied by theoretical computer science \cite{Bille:2005ec}.
Researchers such as Chawathe et al. and Cobena et
al. have studied alternative algorithms, such as subtree hashing, 
and even the use of IDs to align subtrees before similarity 
computation \cite{Chawathe:1996jb,Cobena:2002gd}.  We employ the Zhang 
and Shasha tree difference algorithm to solve the edit distance between
trees \cite{Zhang:1989ec,Zhang:1989il}.

While this topic has been approached rigorously in the computer science literature, few relevant precedents exist in the music literature. Almost all software systems for music document creation assume a single user, and collaborative music document creation exists largely as an experimental pursuit. Precedents fall largely into the category of systems for experimental music and interdisciplinary artistic collaboration. Within these experimental systems, version control for distributed workflows has been addressed only implicitly. For example, although W\"{u}st and Jord\'{a} track versions in a recursively nested, tree-based structure, in which each successive edit becomes a child node of the version edited, they do not describe algorithms or interfaces for calculating edit distances on this version tree \cite{wust2001architectural}. Likewise, other systems describe distributed collaboration interfaces without addressing the interaction of data representation and version comparison \cite{Balachandran:2012cr,Hepting2005}.


\section{Applying The Zhang and Shasha Algorithm}
\subsection{The Zhang and Shasha Algorithm}
Our initial approach uses Zhang and Shasha's tree edit distance
algorithm, as implemented within the \texttt{XUDiff} tool
\cite{Weaver:2013sl}.  The edit distance between two trees is the
minimum number of edit operations necessary to transform one tree into
another.  The edit operations we consider include deleting, changing, and appending tree nodes.  As before, a sequence of edit operations
between two trees is called an \emph{edit script}.



There are several benefits to the Zhang and Shasha tree edit
difference algorithm.  First, the algorithm produces a tree edit
distance that can function flexibly as a metric (assuming the cost function is also a metric). For example, collaborators
can use distance metrics to explore the similarity of an entire corpus of 
musical scores---rather than just two scores---because the metric's notion of distance aligns
with our intuition about distance in the physical world. This distance metaphor allows designers to leverage existing musical research in topological feature similarity metrics, which expands the algorithm's utility beyond the notion of hierarchic diff, into new applications such as automated recommendations based on similarity measures \cite{bello2011measuring,berenzweig2004large,panagakis2010music}. Second, the
algorithm is relatively simple and lends itself to a
straightforward implementation that can be maintained by an
open-source community.  The intent of the open-source community is to
support an extensible framework for hierarchical comparison of a wide
variety of document types across a number of domains.  In the future,
other algorithms, such as those mentioned above, may be implemented to
understand more about the effect of different tree-edit distance
algorithms on similarity results.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\columnwidth]{layers.pdf}
\caption{An edit that switches the first and second voices in a staff. Stem direction is the only visual difference, but the underlying representation changes substantially.}
\label{fig:voice_swap}
\end{figure}

\subsection{A Comparative Example}
Consider the case of a simple edit: exchanging a staff's two voices.
That is, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:voice_swap}, the upward-facing
stems of voice one become the downward-facing stems of voice two, and
vice versa.

While Common Western Notation displays only a change of stem
direction, a tree-based, hierarchic representation of this musical
information must alter both the labeling and succession of elements.
In the MEI XML representation of a music document, the voice-switch
example may be encoded in the following way:


\begin{verbatim}
<staff n="1"> 
    <layer n="1">
        <note pname="a"/>
        <note pname="b"/>
        <note pname="c"/>
    </layer>
    <layer n="2">
        <note pname="e"/>
        <note pname="f"/>
        <note pname="g"/>
    </layer>
</staff>
\end{verbatim}

After the voice swap, the encoding becomes:

\begin{verbatim}

<staff n="1">
    <layer n="1">
        <note pname="e"/>
        <note pname="f"/>
        <note pname="g"/>
    </layer>
    <layer n="2">
        <note pname="a"/>
        <note pname="b"/>
        <note pname="c"/>
    </layer>
</staff>
\end{verbatim}


\subsection{Diff Computation Performance Comparison}
This example, although basic, motivates the need to to compare representations of music in terms of 
hierarchical structure, rather than lines or characters. Figure~\ref{fig:lcs-diff} illustrates an edit script that maps one
version of the above MEI-encoded score to another in terms of lines (LCS algorithm).
The line-based approach successfully captures the need to exchange the
notes between layers; however, the algorithm adds additional noise,
because \code{diff} compares the MEI rather than the hierarchical
structure encoded by the MEI.  As a result, the total edit distance is
10.  If practitioners are interested in understanding change relative
to the hierarchical object model of MEI, they will need to sift
through the noisy changes produced by a line-based comparison.  As
mentioned earlier, this may be problematic for widespread adoption
within the music community.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figures/lcs-diff.pdf}
\caption{The figure above illustrates the output of \code{diff}
  applied to MEI.  A total edit distance of 10 results from updating
  the notes in layer 1 and layer 2 (cost of 6), as well as updating
  \code{layer} tags (cost of 4).  Nearly half of the edit distance is
  `noise' from deleting lines with \code{layer} tags, an artifact of
  comparing versions in terms of lines instead of MEI elements.}
\label{fig:lcs-diff}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/hierarchical-diff.pdf}
\caption{The figure above illustrates the output of \code{xudiff}
  applied to MEI.  A total edit distance of 6 results from updating
  the notes in layer 1 and layer 2.  Total costs are aggregated across
the hierarchical structure of the MEI text.}
\label{fig:hierarchical-diff}
\end{figure}

In contrast, Figure~\ref{fig:hierarchical-diff} illustrates an edit
script that maps one version of the above MEI-encoded score to another
in terms of MEI's hierarchical object model (Zhang and Shasha algorithm).  As with the LCS
algorithm, the tree-based approach successfully captures the need to
exchange the notes between layers; however, unlike the LCS algorithm, the edit distance between individual subtrees has also been
summarized.  This can be helpful for interpretation, as subtrees closer
to the root represent higher-level constructs within MEI, and practitioners can interpret the comparison of the music at multiple levels 
of abstraction, ranging from low-level notes (six \code{notes}, each with an edit cost of 1) 
to higher-level layers (two \code{layers}, each with an edit cost of 3) and staves (one \code{staff}, 
with an edit cost of 6). Most notably, the tree-based element-by-element comparison reduces the edit distance to almost half of that of the LCS algorithm: the edit distance has been reduced to 6, from LCS's 10, most of which was noise from deleting lines with `layer' tags (an artifact of line-based comparison).

\section{Conclusions}
The recently emerged potentials of online, collaborative music applications illustrate several ways that a robust, hierarchic diff algorithm for music can enable newly collaborative musicology, composition, and music education through document utilities \cite{Martin:2015pb,McCulloch:2015pd,Flat:aa,Baca:2015xr}.
Yet the commercial presentation of widely used digital engraving tools still conflates the act of sharing with the act of collaboration,
although these remain distinct from each other.
As a recent advertisement for the Sibelius engraving program exhorts,
`Collaborate more easily with others and distribute your compositions for the world to hear.
Share scores through email, upload and publish them as sheet music on ScoreExchange.com,
and even share your composition as a video or audio file on YouTube, Facebook, and SoundCloud' \cite{Avid:to}.
While file exchange between music authors remains crucial for musical creativity and collaboration beyond notation,
it is time for engraving software to embrace the potentials of genuinely collaborative music document editing interfaces. But distributed music document collaboration requires robust, intuitive version control algorithms and interfaces, and designers must reassess the task of music representation in light of the need for hierarchic diff. The superior performance of the Zhang and Shasha algorithm shown here suggests that purely tree-based representations, such as MEI, should be adopted for collaborative music software systems.
